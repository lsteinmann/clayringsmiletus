Description: Stacking rings are tools used to stack pottery in a Kiln.
    A relatively large group of stacking rings was found in the area of the 
    sanctuary of Dionysos in Miletus in the 1970s. Measurements 
    and additional info is gathered in this package and made available for use
    by other researchers. The data along with its archaeological context 
    and analysis has been published 
    in "Arch√§ologischer Anzeiger" (2020/1, <doi:10.34780/aa.v0i1.1014>).
